# Simple Login Authentication

A simple Login Authentication App using Firebase with Swift Package Manager.

It also consists of Simple side Menu.

This POC is done without Storyboard. Which means everything is done programatically.

* In order to use Firebase, we have to use a plist file which we can generate through https://console.firebase.google.com/ by creating a project and by adding iOS App platform. So, to run this project just get a plist file from Firebase Console and drag it into this project. Then you can able to run this project.
* No worries just follow the steps at https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup
